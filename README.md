- Add tooltip when user makes mistake
- Have separate rounds
   - Find sum of each table
   - Multiply each table by some degree of 'x' to combine families
- Have a 'next' button where user cycles through instructions
- Add more to narrative
- Have directions and narrative not stuck to the top of the page
   - Floats in center of interface
   - Animated in a fun way
- Add music button that allows user to enjoy some Bach Preludes and Fugues
